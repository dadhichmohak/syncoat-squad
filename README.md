# Smart Coatings Optimization using Genetic Algorithms

## Overview

This project explores the formulation of **smart coatings** - advanced paints with enhanced functionalities such as **self-healing, UV resistance, corrosion protection, antimicrobial action,** and **thermochromism**- using a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**-based computational approach.

Our Python model simulates the optimization of coating formulations by balancing **performance** and **cost**. This in-silico approach drastically reduces **R\&D time and expenses**, unlocking rapid innovation for the paints and coatings industry.

## Methodology

1. **Material Database**:
   A dictionary containing multiple base materials and their normalized properties across 9+ parameters.
2. **Fitness Function**:
   Weighted scoring system based on desirable traits and cost penalties.
3. **Genetic Algorithm Process**:

   * Initialize random population of formulations
   * Evaluate fitness of each formulation
   * Select top-performing "parents"
   * Apply crossover and mutation
   * Iterate for multiple generations
   * Return the optimal formulation
